             <td class="description">I like connecting the dots, I like putting two random pieces together to hear that "click" sound. 
                 I started off my career in sales to gradually develop as a generalist. 
                 I prefer to work on something which hasn't been attempted or done successfully before. 
                 I don't measure experience in years but in the number of things one ventures into and takes from it, it cannot be quantified. 
                 I love working with long-term players who are ambitious, understand downsides and upsides of risks, growth-oriented and ethical. </td> </tr>
